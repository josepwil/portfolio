A Full Stack MERN Application for creating and finding projects.

Right now I have only created a basic implementation since the project was sidelined due to other commitments. Initial plans were to create profile pages and a way to volunteer to 'team up' on a project as well as a review system for team members upon project completion.

<strong>Tech Stack: Typescript, ReactJS, Node/Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sass</strong>
