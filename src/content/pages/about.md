Thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio!

I moved to Vancouver in May 2018 and starting working as a tech recruiter for a major agency downtown. In connecting with many talented software developers my interest in coding steadily grew.

I initially decided to start teaching myself to code on evenings and at weekends. I would finish my work day and open up freeCodeCamp or whatever udemy course I happened to be working on at the time.

The more I coded the more I fell in love with coding, sure there were times when I would stare blankly at my screen for 30 minutes with no idea what was going wrong in my application but there were also plenty of moments of elation when I finally figured it out.

After a while it became pretty apparent to me that I wanted to take this further, make a career switch and transition into the industry. One of the first friends I made in Vancouver happened to have done a similar thing after attending Lighthouse Labs and getting a diploma in Web Development so I figured that could be the way to go and submitted my application.

I wanted to make sure that I was as prepared as I could be, so that I could make the most of my experience and maximise the amound I learned from the course. To that end I decided to enroll in CS50, Harvards introduction to Computer Science. This was a 12 week part time course that I could do online, comprised of weekly problem sets and one final project.

I am very happy that I took CS50, it really reinforced the programming knowledge I had accumulated up to that point and helped me think programmtically. It also exposed me to some languages I had not used before notably C and SQL. I completed the course, with my final project being an application for finding and logging hikes, built using Python/Flask.

In November 2020 I left my job in recruitment and started at Lighthouse Labs full-time, the course was fast paced and the workload heavy, but I was really happy to be there. It was great to be able to dedicate so much of my time to improving my craft and expanding my knowledge.

I learnt new languages (Ruby) and finally got to work with React - I had been putting off jumping into React too early on my own as I wanted to cement my understanding/ability with vanilla javascript first.

The course was fantastic, I could feel my skills improving on a daily basis and got to work on a ton of projects both individually and as part of a team, some of which you will see highlighted on this site. This culminated in our final and largest group project Beanli.

At the end of February I graduated from Lighthouse Labs with a Diploma of Web Development and that brings us to today and writing this first 'About' section. I'll be continuing to build projects and at the same time trying to land my first job as a Developer.
