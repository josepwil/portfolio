Team Up is an app to find developers to collaborate on projects. If you have an idea for a project that is too big in scope to work on alone you can post it on Team Up and see if any developers want to take part. Likewise if you are stuck on ideas for projects or just want to work on a project with multiple devs you can browse the project listings and see if anything catches your eye.

<strong>Tech Stack: Typescript, ReactJS, Node/Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sass</strong>
